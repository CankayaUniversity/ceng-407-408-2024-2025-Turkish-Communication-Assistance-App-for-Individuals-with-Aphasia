# APPHASIA
## Project Description
"Apphasia" is an innovative mobile application designed specifically for Turkish-speaking individuals with aphasia, a condition that impairs communication due to brain damage. This app aims to empower users to express their needs, emotions, and thoughts more effectively through a user-friendly interface that offers pre-configured phrases, images, and customizable gestures. With an emphasis on accessibility, the app supports offline functionality, ensuring uninterrupted communication even in areas with limited internet connectivity. By leveraging the built-in accessibility features of iOS and Android, Apphasia accommodates users with diverse cognitive, physical, and technical backgrounds, enabling seamless interaction through simplified controls, voice output, and visual aids.

The application further enriches user experience by providing personalized features such as customizable emoticons, daily routine scheduling, and rehabilitation exercises tailored to individual needs. Its design caters to left-handed users, offers drawing tools for symbol-based communication, and maintains a lightweight footprint to operate efficiently on low-spec devices. By prioritizing security and usability, Apphasia stands as a reliable assistive technology solution, committed to improving the quality of life for aphasia patients and breaking communication barriers in their daily lives.
